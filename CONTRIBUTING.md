# Contributing to Solid

Thanks for taking the time to help us build Solid 🎉

The most important part of our test suite is the directory `test/cases`.
Inside `test/cases/` we have `input.liquid` files that are tested against Solid and against the Liquid gem.

Whenever possible we want to include a new test case that covers the new feature that was added or bug that has been fixed. So if it makes sense please include a new test case or change an existing one that makes sense.
